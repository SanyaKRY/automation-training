If you put me to the test, if you let me try
Gonna do my very best and it ain't no lie 
Take a chance on me 
Honey I'm still free 
If you're all alone when the pretty birds have flown 
If you've got no place to go, if you're feeling down 
If you need me, let me know, gonna be around 
Take a chance on me 
Honey I'm still free 
ï»¿If you change your mind, I'm the first in line
